  * [Hermit programmers are dead](https://www.cesarsotovalero.net/blog/hermit-programmers-are-dead.html "Hermit programmers are dead") — However, with the advent of cloud computing and AI, the scenery may change soon for this profession. It’s time for programmers to mutate into sociable software engineers, recap and re-adapt, and take advantage of the only thing that machines cannot overtake: our human nature. Otherwise, I believe misfit programmers will perish… for sure.
  * [Why OpenAI’s Codex Won’t Replace Coders ](https://spectrum-ieee-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/spectrum.ieee.org/amp/openai-wont-replace-coders-2655177877 "Why OpenAI’s Codex Won’t Replace Coders ") — It might create a new specialty, too: "prompt engineering," the often-complex process of crafting the textual prompts which allow AI systems like Codex to work their magic.
  * [Majority of developers spending half, or less, of their day coding, report finds](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/majority-of-developers-spending-half-or-less-of-their-day-coding-report-finds/ "Majority of developers spending half, or less, of their day coding, report finds") — If you only get four hours max to code during the work day you're not alone, according to ActiveState's 2019 developer survey.
  * [Coverage Is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness · It Will Never Work in Theory](https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/09/24/coverage-is-not-strongly-correlated-with-test-suite-effectiveness.html "Coverage Is Not Strongly Correlated with Test Suite Effectiveness · It Will Never Work in Theory") — We found that code coverage is a poor predictor of how effective a test suite is at detecting bugs once the size of the test suite is accounted for.
  * [Internal Tech Emails on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1444367219509637123 "Internal Tech Emails on Twitter") — Apple execs describe a "unique arrangement" with Netflix
  * [Python Sample for Tip of the Week](https://gist.github.com/dominickm/cf4b019fc098f2c3b10a25bd645ce52b "Python Sample for Tip of the Week") — This is an example of being able to use type hinting on a return < Python 3.10. In 3.10 the from __future__ will not be required. This requires Python 3.6+
  * [What’s New In Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html "What’s New In Python 3.10")
  * [Python 3.10 Release Stream — with Pablo Galindo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHT2l3hcIJg "Python 3.10 Release Stream — with Pablo Galindo - YouTube") — Python 3.10 is set to be released on 4 October 2021. Join us live in our Python 3.10 Release Stream with Pablo Galindo, CPython Core Developer and Python 3.10 Release Manager, and Leon Sandøy.
