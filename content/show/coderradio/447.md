  * [Michael Dominick on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1477440229149908994 "Michael Dominick on Twitter") — I am on the DL going to set my kid up his own PC (an old Mac mini) I'd like it to run a Kiddie flavor of #Linux and be good to before he gets. I also want 0 internet access. Is KidBuntu still a thing? @ubuntu I'd like a kid / education focused distro. THX!
  * [quickemu](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu "quickemu") — Quickly create and run optimised Windows, macOS and Linux desktop virtual machines. 
  * [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/ "Ultimate Hacking Keyboard") — A fully programmable, impeccably built, open source, split mechanical keyboard designed for extreme productivity and ergonomics.
  * [What's Apple Releasing in 2022?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-02/what-s-apple-aapl-releasing-in-2022-iphone-14-airpods-pro-2-imac-pro-ipads-kxxmcej5 "What's Apple Releasing in 2022?") — The company has a bevy of new pro Macs in the works based on the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips that are already inside the MacBook Pro. That includes a smaller Mac Pro with up to 40 CPU cores and 128 graphics cores, a new Mac mini and a large-screened iMac Pro. I’d expect Apple to finish announcing its transition to its own silicon from Intel chips as early as June at WWDC 2022.
